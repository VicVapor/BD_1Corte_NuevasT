				Título: A systematic literature review on automatic website generation
			</h1>
			<h5>Autores: Thisaranie Kaluarachchi, Manjusri Wickramasinghe</h5>

				<strong>Resumen:</strong>
				Since machine learning became a prominent feature in the modern-day computing landscape, the urge to
				automate processes has increased. One such process of particular interest has been the automatic
				generation of websites based on user intention. Though the requirement of such automatic generation is a
				modern-day need, the quality of the automatic generation still provides a unique set of challenges. As
				such, to analyze these unique challenges and viable opportunities in automatic website generation, this
				survey systematically reviews research on the topics of automatic website generation. The analysis
				initially segments state-of-the-art into three categories based on the dominant strategy used for
				automatic generation. These strategies are examples-based, mock-up-driven, and artificial
				intelligence-driven automatic website generation. When considering the example-based strategy, the
				emphasis is on analyzing how manual design aspects of a professionally developed website are
				incorporated into generation models and the challenges that arise. Similarly, transformation methods
				from website visual design into functional GUI code are investigated for the mock-up-driven strategy
				with a particular reference to the six underlying conversion mechanisms. Finally, artificial
				intelligence website builders are analyzed based on their ability to build customizable websites to user
				preferences. Based on this systematic review of 47 research works on the three dominant strategies, this
				survey outlines unique challenges and future research endeavors that researchers would encounter when
				developing models that generate websites automatically and provides insights to researchers on selecting
				a website generation strategy based on user intention appropriately.
